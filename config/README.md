# Configurations

Configuration provides certain arguments of specific algorithm modules or robot controllers. For example, if we want to calibrate our robot system with RGB-D camera, arguments such as starting point and strict length in each axis should be set.

We provide configuration templates of calibration module and robot arm controller here. You can create your own configurations for your own modules or controllers.
