# The DeepClaw Benchmark

The DeepClaw is a benchmarking model zoo that functions as a Reconfigurable Robotic Manipulation System for Robot Learning. The main homepage can be found at [here](https://bionicdl-sustech.github.io/DeepClawBenchmark/). This is the GitHub repository of DeepClaw source code, including instructions for installing and using DeepClaw.

## Code Organization

The DeepClaw code is organized as follows:

    configs/                    configuration for robotic station for manipulation tasks.
    deepclaw/drivers/           drivers for various robotic hardware, i.e. ur, franka, aubo.
    deepclaw/models/            model zoo for segmentation, classification, pick planning, and motion planning.
    deepclaw/utils/             server setup with dockers and client setup for laptops (x86) and jetson (arm).
    projects/proj_TrashSorting  a sample project to run deepclaw for sorting trash.
    datasets/trash              description of trash sorting dataset
    docs/                       description of this document as a manual.
    data/trash                  data on trash sorting
